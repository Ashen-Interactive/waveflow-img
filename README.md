`waveflow-img` is a simple command-line tool that uses the **Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** algorithm to generate procedural image maps based on luminance constraints and directional adjacency rules.

Designed for 2D tilemaps/top-down views of 3D games, it processes an input image and emits a new WFC-generated image.

## âœ¨ Features

- Simple configuration via `.yaml`
- Automatically extracts directional adjacency rules from luminance
- Adjustable number of luminance levels
- Compatible with full-color input images (uses luminance)
- Easy to install and use via CLI

## ðŸš€ Installation

Install via [cargo](https://crates.io):

```bash
cargo install waveflow-img
```

---

## Usage

```bash
waveflow-img input.yaml output.png
```

> Type `waveflow-img --help` for help!

---

## Example YAML (input.yaml):

```yaml
input_image: "example.png"
output_width: 64
output_height: 64
tile_size: 1
luminance_levels: 5
adjacency: {} # Will be implemented soon, right now it gets extracted
```

---

## How It Works

- The image is converted to grayscale using ITU-R BT.709 luminance.
- Each pixel is assigned a discrete level (e.g. 1â€“5).
- Adjacency rules are extracted from neighboring pixels.
- Wave Function Collapse fills the output grid using these constraints.
- The result is converted back into a grayscale image for saving.
